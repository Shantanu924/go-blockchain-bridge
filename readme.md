This project is a blockchain bridge  that connects Ethereum and Solana blockchains. It consists of a backend written in Go and a frontend built with React and Vite.

## Features

- **Backend**:
  - Fetches Ethereum block data using the Infura API.
  - Fetches Solana account balance using the Solana SDK.
